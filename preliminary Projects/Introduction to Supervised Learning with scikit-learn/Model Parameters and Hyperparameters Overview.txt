
Which of the following is NOT a machine learning model used in the exercise?


Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Random Forest

Linear Regression

Neural Network

Ans : Linear Regression


How can changing hyperparameter values impact a model's performance?


It can only improve the model's performance.

It has no effect on the model's performance.

It only affects the model's visualization.

It can lead to both improvements and deteriorations in performance.

Ans : It can lead to both improvements and deteriorations in performance.


True or False: The accuracy of the SVM with linear kernel model decreases with low values of C.


False

True

Ans : True

True or False: The accuracy of the Random Forest model decreases with low values of max_depth (with max_depth=2 and 5).


False

True

Ans : False
