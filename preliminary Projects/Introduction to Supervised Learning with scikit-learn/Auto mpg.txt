Fit a logistic regression model using the given input and output patterns X and Y, respectively. Once fitted, determine the precision of this fitted logistic regression model using the test dataset.

X_train = [[4,2,1],[3,4,6],[5,6,7],[8,9,7]]
y_train = [1,2,1,2]
X_test = [[4,3,1],[2,4,3],[5,6,1],[5,9,9]]
y_test = [1,2,2,2]
Use random_state=0 in the model and average='weighted'to calculate the precision. round to two decimal places the result.


Ans : 0.83



Fit a Decision Tree model using the input patterns X and the corresponding output patterns Y. After fitting, evaluate the recall of the fitted Decision Tree model using the test dataset.

X_train = [[4,2,1],[3,4,6],[5,6,7],[8,9,7]]
y_train = [1,2,1,2]
X_test = [[4,3,1],[2,4,3],[5,6,1],[5,9,9]]
y_test = [1,2,2,2]
Use random_state=0 in the model and average='weighted'to calculate the recall. round to two decimal places the result.

Ans : 0.75


Fit a Decision Tree and a Logistic Regression model using the input patterns X and the corresponding output patterns Y. After fitting, compare the performance of both models in terms of F1-score and determine which one presents the best results.

Decision tree

Logistic Regression

Boths models presents similar values of f1-score


Ans : Decision Tree



Precision and Recall

Letâ€™s say we have a machine that classifies if a fruit is an apple or not.

Precision measures how many of our classified oranges were actually oranges.

Recall measures how many of our classified oranges were actually apples.

Recall measures how many apples we might have missed in the entire sample of fruit.

Precision will measure the amount of misclassified oranges as apples (False Positives) and the amount of apples not correctly classified as apples (False Negatives).


Ans : A and C
