Activity 3: Visualizing Yearly Passenger Numbers
# Load the dataset
flights = pd.read_csv('flights.csv')

# Aggregate data by year
yearly_passengers = flights.groupby('year')['passengers'].sum().reset_index()

# Create the line plot
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot(yearly_passengers['year'], yearly_passengers['passengers'])
ax.set_title('Yearly Passenger Numbers')
ax.set_xlabel('Year')
ax.set_ylabel('Number of Passengers')

# Show the plot
plt.show()
